# ðŸ§ª SolidWorks Simulation Material Library Macro

This project involved creating a **SolidWorks macro** to automate **material assignment** and manage a **custom material library** for simulation purposes.  
It streamlines the process of preparing parts and assemblies for **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)** by standardizing material properties.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
- **Objective**:
  - Enable quick assignment of materials to parts and assemblies
  - Maintain a **centralized custom material library** for consistent simulation setups
  - Allow engineers to add, modify, or select materials through a **UserForm interface**
  - Read material properties from an **Excel file** and integrate them directly into the SolidWorks material library
  - Reduce manual errors and save time during FEA preparation
- **Deliverable**: A **VBA macro with UserForm** embedded in SolidWorks, automating material selection and assignment for simulation-ready models.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Features
- **SolidWorks 2024**
- **VBA Macro with UserForm**:
  - Dropdown list of predefined **material options**  
  - Buttons for:
    - **Apply Material** â†’ Assigns the selected material to the active component
    - **Add/Modify Material** â†’ Updates or creates new material entries in the library
    - **Preview Material Properties** â†’ Displays key properties such as density, Youngâ€™s modulus, and Poissonâ€™s ratio
- **Excel Integration**:
  - Material properties are **read from an Excel file**  
  - Automatically added to SolidWorks **custom material library**
  - Supports batch addition and ensures consistency across projects
- Fully compatible with **SolidWorks Simulation** for FEA setups

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Learnings
- Streamlined **FEA preparation workflow** by automating material assignments  
- Created a **user-friendly interface** for material selection and management  
- Leveraged **Excel integration** to populate SolidWorks material library efficiently  
- Ensured **data consistency** for simulations across assemblies  
- Saved significant time and reduced errors during model setup
