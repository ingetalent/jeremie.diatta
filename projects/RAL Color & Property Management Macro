# ðŸŽ¨ SolidWorks RAL Color & Property Management Macro

This project focused on creating a **SolidWorks macro with a UserForm** to manage **RAL colors, feature visibility, and custom properties** efficiently.  
The solution helps engineers and designers standardize colors while maintaining accurate metadata in parts and assemblies.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
- **Objective**: Simplify the process of:
  - Applying standardized **RAL colors** to parts and assemblies
  - **Hiding/unhiding features** interactively from a macro
  - Adding, updating, and managing **custom properties** (e.g., Material, Finish, Project Code) via a UserForm
  - Exchanging property data with **Excel** for reporting and documentation
- **Deliverable**: A **VBA macro with a modern UserForm** embedded into SolidWorks, providing engineers a centralized tool for color and property management.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Features
- **SolidWorks 2024**
- **VBA Macro & UserForm** with:
  - Dropdown list with predefined **RAL colors**
  - Checkboxes for **feature hide/unhide**
  - Text fields for **custom property entry and modification**
  - **Transmit to 3D** button â†’ Applies the values entered in the UserForm directly to the model  
  - **Read from 3D** button â†’ Extracts selected custom properties from the active model, copies them into the clipboard, and allows pasting them into **Excel** for reporting
- **Custom Properties API** used to ensure metadata consistency across assemblies and parts

## ðŸ“‚ Deliverables
- **SolidWorks VBA Macro** with UserForm  
- Predefined **RAL Color Database** integrated into dropdown list  
- Full support for:
  - **Property editing and transmission to 3D**
  - **Color application**
  - **Feature visibility toggling**
  - **Property extraction to clipboard for Excel use**  
- Video demo showing real workflow usage

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Learnings
- Enhanced **user interaction in SolidWorks macros** using UserForms  
- Leveraged **API for color, feature, and property control**  
- Created a reliable **two-way data exchange** between SolidWorks and Excel (via clipboard)  
- Improved **workflow efficiency** for large projects requiring consistent RAL colors and structured metadata
