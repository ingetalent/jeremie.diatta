# Diamond DA62 Aircraft Design in SolidWorks

![Aircraft DA62](../img/da62-placeholder.png)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project is a **3D CAD modeling study** of the Diamond DA62 aircraft, created in **SolidWorks 2024**.  
The design was inspired by a scaled miniature model and serves as a **portfolio demonstrator** for large and complex assemblies.

## ðŸ”§ Skills & Tools
- SolidWorks 2024 (Surface & Solid modeling)  
- Assembly management & constraints  
- Parametric design approach  
- Rendering & visualization  

## ðŸš€ Value
This project highlights my ability to design **aeronautical structures**, manage **complex assemblies**, and create **high-quality parametric models**.
