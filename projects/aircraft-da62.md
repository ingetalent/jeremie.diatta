# ‚úàÔ∏è Aircraft DA62 ‚Äì 3D CAD Modeling

## Overview
This project is a **SolidWorks 2024 3D model** of the Diamond DA62 aircraft.  
It is based on a physical scale model and designed as a **portfolio showcase project** for advanced surface modeling, assembly, and product design workflows.

## Features
- Full-scale aircraft CAD design  
- Parametric modeling of fuselage, wings, and tail  
- High-quality rendering for visualization  
- Assembly with correct geometric constraints  

## Tools & Skills
- SolidWorks 2024  
- Advanced surfacing & assemblies  
- Rendering & visualization
