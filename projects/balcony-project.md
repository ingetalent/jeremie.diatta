# 🏢 SolidWorks Balcony Automation Project

This project involved the automation of **balustrade (balcony railing) design** in SolidWorks.  
The client required a solution where the **balustrade assembly adapts automatically** to site measurements, with post spacing, glass panel dimensions, and heights updating dynamically.

---

## 🔹 Project Overview
- **Objective**: Automate the creation of balcony assemblies where:
  - Post spacing is calculated automatically based on maximum allowed distance.
  - Number of posts adapts dynamically to the balcony size.
  - Glass panel dimensions adjust automatically while maintaining required offsets.
  - Overall height is adjustable while keeping handrails, clamps, and gaps consistent.
- **Deliverable**: A **SolidWorks macro with userform** that links to an **Excel post spacing calculator**, enabling automatic updates of the assembly.

## 🛠 Tools & Methods
- **SolidWorks 2024** Assemblies, Weldments, and Sheet Metal
- **VBA for SolidWorks API**:
  - Macro with UserForm interface
  - Reads dimension values from Excel
  - Updates posts, glass panels, and handrail heights
- **Excel Integration**:
  - Post Spacing Calculator.xlsx used for spacing logic
  - Normalized and non-normalized site dimensions supported

## 📂 Deliverables
- **SolidWorks Assembly File** – parametric balcony model  
- **Excel Post Spacing Calculator** – driving dimensions and logic  
- **SolidWorks VBA Macro** – automation for posts, glass, and height adjustments  
- **Video Demos** – showing resizing, recalculation, and assembly automation  

---

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Applied **SolidWorks API** to a real-world architectural engineering problem  
- Integrated **Excel logic with CAD automation** for adaptive design  
- Optimized workflow by eliminating manual recalculation of posts and panels  
- Ensured scalability for different balcony sizes and configurations
