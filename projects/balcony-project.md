# 🏢 SolidWorks Balcony Design & Automation

This project demonstrates the use of **SolidWorks** for architectural and structural design automation.  
The goal was to create a **balcony model** with configurable parameters and to automate the export of manufacturing files.

---

## 🔹 Project Overview
The balcony project focused on:
- Designing a **parametric balcony assembly** with railings, panels, and supports.  
- Automating **BOM (Bill of Materials) extraction** for all components.  
- Exporting **sheet metal and weldment parts as DXF** files in structured folders for manufacturing.  
- Simplifying the workflow for repetitive architectural elements.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Methods
- **SolidWorks 2024** (Assemblies, Sheet Metal, Weldments)  
- **VBA Macros** for:
  - BOM extraction and formatting  
  - DXF export with folder organization by material and thickness  
  - File renaming and revision management

## 📂 Deliverables
- **SolidWorks Assembly File** – parametric balcony model  
- **Drawing File** – including BOM table and detail views  
- **DXF Exports** – ready for manufacturing  
- **Macro Code** – VBA scripts for BOM and DXF automation  

---

## 🎯 Key Learnings
- Applied **SolidWorks automation** to an architectural use case  
- Improved efficiency by eliminating manual DXF export steps  
- Structured BOM and manufacturing data for real-world usability
