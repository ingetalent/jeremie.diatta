# 🏎️ F1 Helmet Design – SolidWorks Surfacing Tutorial  

## 📌 Overview  
This project demonstrates the creation of a **Formula 1 racing helmet** using advanced **SolidWorks surfacing and design techniques**.  
It was inspired by the [LearnSolidWorks tutorial bundle](https://learnsolidworks.com/master-bundle-trial), and serves as a training showcase for **complex shape modeling**.  

## 🎯 Learning Objectives  
- Apply **surface modeling** to create complex organic shapes.  
- Learn how to **combine surfacing and solid modeling** workflows.  
- Explore techniques for **fillets, shelling, and detail features** in product design.  
- Gain practical experience with **parametric control of freeform geometry**.  

## 🛠️ Techniques & Tools Used  
- Surface Loft & Boundary Surface  
- Surface Knit & Trim Surface  
- Shell, Fillet, and Offset operations  
- Split Line for details  
- Rendering setup for visualization  

## 📸 Preview  
Here is the result of the F1 helmet modeling exercise:
